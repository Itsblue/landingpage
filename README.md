# landingpage
A landingpage for users with some links and options to change their LDAP password and email.

# Usage
- Put the index.php and config.php.example into a webroot and rename config.php.example to config.php.
- Make all necessary changes to config.php
- If you don't want to have index.php in the URL, use Apache2 and make sure mod_rewrite is enabled
- Enjoy ;)
